1. A page can have only one head element, and the same goes for the body element.  The head elements is used to import other files and define the attributes of the page that are not displayed on the viewer's computer.  The body is where all of the "meat and potatoes" of your website that should be displayed need to be.
2. Structural markups embed the information about the structure of a document, includes things like headings, paragraphs, and lists. Semantic markups are used to reinforce the semantics- or meaning- of the information in a document.
3. For this assignment, I just followed the directions sequentially.  I used a dish that I have made myself to put on the website.  I love to cook so this was a fun assignment for me.  The only difficult part was actually creating a recipe for my dish because I never work from recipes or write anything down when I create a meal.  Lastly, I ended with this readme file.
