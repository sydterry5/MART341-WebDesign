1. I learned of a couple different form options while browsing, one being the radio box control.  This form allows the user to select on of a limited number of choices.  Another form I found was the checkbox which lets a user select any number of options of a limited number of choices.
2. Text input- could be first name, last name, date of birth, a username or password.
   Selection input- radio buttons, checkbox element, or select box
   Button input- upload, submit, image, and button
3. My work cycle was a bit all over the place this week.  It was a lot of trial and error with this assignment as I found the material a bit more complex than previous.  I had to consult a lot with W3 school because it is a really helpful tool for me.  With this assignment, using W3 helped me specifically with being able to see the live preview of what I was working on.  I think I finally ended up in the right ballpark after a few hours of frustration.
