1. Universal selectors are used to style every element on a page.  An element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type.  A class selector select elements that serve the same class attribute. Finally, ID selectors allow developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID.
2. For this assignment I really was looking for colors that could be associated with the 1970s and the culture surrounding that decade.  I used earthy tones such as golden rod, indian red, and a darkslategrey. You can really see colors like these in 70s fashion.
3. I had quite a bit of challenges just getting my head around all of the different style elements and CSS formats. The concept I wanted my page to be about came to me pretty quickly because I love the 1970s, especially music from that time period. I also struggled with grasping the concept of selectors and the true purpose they serve.
