        <p>During the 1970s, music was becoming more expressive and heavier. One of the heavier sub genres being punk rock. Originally brought over from the U.K, punk made its debut as a popular scene in New York City. Bands such as The Sex Pistols, Television, The New York Dolls, The Ramones, and Iggy Pop are among the well known punk OGs. Punk music was surrounded by a movement of unrest, social change, not confining to conformity.</p>
      <h2>The Fashion</h2>

          <p>"Seventies fasion saw bold colors and patterns take center stage. Women's fashion looked back to the 1940s by day and pumped up glamour by night. Men had an array of suit types to choose from and favored colorful plaids. Children's fashion followed adult fashion with bold plaids and bright colors with the distinction between genders lesseing throughout the decade."- Karina Reddy</p>
