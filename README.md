1. System Font- the fonts already installed on your local device/system, they are available to most programs you use but not always to the web.
   Web Font- custom fonts hosted on a server and do not need to be available on the user's device to appear but require certain elements to get called up correctly.
   Web-Safe Font- fonts that developers can count on being available by the system are known as "web-safe" and include font families that both Windows and Mac should have
2. The importance of having fallback fonts and font stacks are so that if the font-family property fails to load for some reason there is a back up font.
3. This assignment was pretty self-explanatory in most aspects.  I did struggle a bit with complementary fonts and understanding the two font files (font-regular.tff/font-italic.ttf).  I referenced W3 schools a lot for this one and still don't get it.
