# Sydney Terry MART341-WebDesign
Repository for my Intro to Web Design Homework
My week has been a little chaotic tackling a full class load and working full time, but it's also been good in that way.  In terms of this class I have really enjoyed what we have been doing so far because everything is completely new to me and I love challenging myself.  I think the biggest challenge for me so far has been just understanding all of the different terminology and how to apply them.  That being said, I've been doing better than I thought I would at understanding how to do the assignment.
