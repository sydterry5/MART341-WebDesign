    <h1>White Fang</h1>
    <h3>By: Jack London</h3>
    <h5>Chapter 1 Teaser</h5>
    <section>
        <hr>
        <div class="opening-paragraph">
            "Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent
            wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous,
            in the fading light.  A vast silence reigned over the land.  The land itself was a desolation, lifeless,
            without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness.  There was a hint
            in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness- a laughter that was mirthless as the
            smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility.
        </div>
        <div class="second-paragraph">
            It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort
            life.  It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.  But there was life, abroad in the land
            and defiant.  Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs.  Their bristly fur was rimed with frost.
            Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the
            hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost.  Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces
            attached them to a sled which dragged along behind.  The sled was without runners.
        </div>
        <div class="third-paragraph">
            It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow.  The front end of the sled was
            turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave
            before it.  On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and narrow oblong box.  There were other things on
            the sled- blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space,
            was the long and narrow oblong box."
