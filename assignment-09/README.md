1. I definitely had to go back and review quite a bit of things on this assignment.  I also had to do some outside research, such as navigation and styling. However, it was really cool to start the styling process of web design because I feel that's where  I can express my creativity the most.
2. With the next module, I am most excited to see what other elements of a page can be stylized and hopefully get better at creating a style more suited to myself. I hope to do more with backgrounds and color, as well as images.
3. Doing this assignment, the new material was actually pretty challenging to me.  Trying to keep track of all of the different stylized elements that go along with each part of the page was difficult. I feel I was most successful stylizing my first page and getting the images in easily.
