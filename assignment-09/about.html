                <strong>Why did you choose this project?</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I chose this project because I have a sister who is fostering a young boy and during COVID was losing her mind.  She was trying so hard to keep entertaining him with new things, this was similar to something she had done with him.  I also feel this is just a really cool craft for not only young kids but even adults too.

                    <li>
                        It means that our world continues on no matter what else might be going on in our lives.
