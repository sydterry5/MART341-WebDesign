1.  For my library, I chose Bootstrap 4.
2. I download the files for it, because it was the best way to compile the other files and get the code into my project.
3. Html5 changes the web by introducing a new version of the html language, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allow for the building of more diverse and powerful web sites and applications.
4. Honestly, my biggest challenge was just understanding the difference of the multiple libraries and how to integrate them into my project. I explored many other resources to help with my confusion and hopefully I actually got some of it right.
